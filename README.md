# passwordManagerPython
I made this in my free time to practice more python, I decided for a password manager because I suck at memorizing my passwords and prefer to create stuff I'd frequently use to ensure it's bug free.

 password manager that locally encrypts your passwords with b64 made in python
 
 the commands aren't case sensitive, your site, UID and password are.
 
 Be aware that if you lose your .txt file or it gets wiped the passwords are gone, so it's always good to save a copy of it somewhere.
 
 
 
 To Do:
 
 rename .txt file
 
 fix spacing in showing the logins
