# passwordManagerPython
I made this in my free time to practice more python, I decided for a password manager because I suck at memorizing my passwords and prefer to create stuff I'd frequently use to ensure it's bug free.

 password manager that locally encrypts your passwords with b64 made in python
 
 the commands aren't case sensitive, your site, UID and password are.
 
 Be aware that if you lose your .txt file or it gets wiped the passwords are gone, so it's always good to save a copy of it somewhere.
 
 Spacing in show all becomes messy for Site and UID inputs longer than 31 in length, "ThisIsARandomUIDWithALengthOf31" is an example of the maximun length to make it still looks clean.
 
 Passwords can be any length, but may continue on the next line while doing show all depending your console window width.
 
 
 
 To Do:
 
 rename .txt file
 
 fix spacing in showing the logins
